I'm a pragma builder by presenter.
I build magritte descriptions filtered by <presenters> pragma (if no presenters defined it will be interpreted as "all presenters").
I also filter other pragmas as <hidden>.

Available pragmas: 

<presenters: #(name1 name2 ...)>		Define presenter names
<hidden>							Hidden description
